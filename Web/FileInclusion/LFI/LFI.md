# Local File Inclusion {LFI}

## Overview

+ LFI vulnerabilities refer to any scenario where an attacker is able to induce the web application/web server into accessing or executing files on the host
+ The 'included' files may be attacker uploaded scripts, files which exist already on the web server (or file system), or another users files
+ LFI is a relatively broad category of vulnerability which is generally very specific to the web application
+ There are however a number of common LFI vulnerabilities and 'common' scenarios
