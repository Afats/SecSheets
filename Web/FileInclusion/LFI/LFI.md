# Local File Inclusion (LFI)

LFI vulnerabilities refer to any scenario where an attacker is able to induce the web application/web server into accessing or executing files on the host. The 'included' files may be attacker uploaded scripts, files which exist already on the web server (or file system), or another users files. LFI is a relatively broad category of vulnerability which is generally very specific to the web application.
