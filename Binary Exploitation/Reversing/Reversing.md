# Reversing

## Overview

Reversing is the process of taking something (not necessarily a program), in its completed or built state, and attempting to make sense of its inner workings. Reversing forms the backbone for a lot of other topics in security and software and thus a good understanding of reversing strategies goes along way. 

## Static Reversing

### Dumping Binaries

+ Before cracking open a disassembler like cutter, binja or r2 it can be useful to dump some of the binary contents using simple command line tools

#### Listing Strings

+ Its always a good idea to see what printable strings a compiled program contains

`strings <binary>`

+ For a less cluttered view of strings likely added by the programmer use r2's cli tools

`rabin2 -z split`

#### Listing Functions

+ All binary functions can be listed with objdump

`objdump -t <binary>`

+ Defined functions with interesting symbols can be listed using `nm` or r2s cli tool `rabin2`

`rabin2 -qs ret2win32 | grep -ve imp -e ' 0 '`
