# Return Oriented Programming (ROP)

Return Oriented programming or ROP is the binary exploiters ultimate example of living off the land. Compilers are *complex* and imperfect. When they take in source code and translate it into a complete machine readable package, a binary, they leave behind **extra** instructions along side those **needed** to carry out the programs operations. An attacker can harness these instructions or 'gadgets' placing them into a chain to complete near arbitrary goals.
