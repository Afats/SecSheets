# Heap Exploits

Heap exploitation classifies a diverse range of attacks against heap implementations themselves as well as interactions with data stored on the heap. Fundamentally however heap exploitation centers around being able to modify chunks (data) on the heap 'arbitrarily'. Three main vulnerability classes give rise to this behavior:

+ Use After Free
+ Double Free
+ Overflows

which in turn form the basis for a swath of heap exploitation strategies.


## Use After Free (UAF)

UAF vulnerabilities are probably the most common form of heap vulnerabilities due to their 'prevalence' in large code bases. They refer to a situation where a pointer to a heap chunk, generally from `malloc`, is freed, the memory returned to the heap allocator,
