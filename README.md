SecSheets
==========

SecSheets is a collection of security focused reference sheets which act as a manual for various topics and sub-topics in security.

## Overview

SecSheets aims to act as a manual for both beginners entering the field of security testing and hardened 
veterans of the craft. The project aims to provide an overview of all the components and sub-topics that make up various feilds in security. In this way a beginner can grasp the scope of a field and make informed decisions about their learning path. On the other hand experienced testers can use the manuals to help in finding write-ups or to review less common vulnerabilities and emerging techniques.

This project no-longer seeks to imitate the amazing [Payload-all-the-things](#) repo but instead tries to provide example driven explanations, quality references and a sound overview of particular topics in security.

## Contributing
