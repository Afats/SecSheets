# Contributing

The most valuable contributions to the repo are any at all, but ones which add, new, previously unexplored, content are super neat. This could be new sections in existing articles or new articles all together. Consider including:

+ Diagrams
+ References
+ Examples
+ Relevant code snippets
+ Scripts


Unlike many repos on GitHub no contribution to this repo will not be considered 'to small'. Even minimal additions or changes can be extremely valuable, especially where I have made horrible mistakes!

## Thank You!

Lastly thanks for contributing to this project! I hope that one day this repo can be a useful resource for people.
