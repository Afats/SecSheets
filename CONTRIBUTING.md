## New Issues 

Before you drop an issue.txt:

+ Take a look at the list of currently unresolved issues, bug reports and feature requests.
+ If your issue, or a very similar issue, has already been submitted bump/upvote the issue or leave a comment rather than generating a new issue. 

## Contributing

The most valuable contributions to the repo are any at all, but ones which add new, previously unexplored, content are super neat. This could be new sections in existing articles or new articles all together. Consider including:

+ Diagrams
+ References
+ Examples
+ Relevant code snippets
+ Scripts


Unlike many repos on GitHub no contribution to this repo will not be considered 'to small'. Even minimal additions or changes can be extremely valuable (remember that time you couldn't find quite the right payload for a CTF ...)!

If you can't validate or find a reference which supports a conclusion in your contribution make a comment describing why you think what you have said is right or potential issues with your description(s).

## Thank You!

Lastly thanks for contributing to this project! I hope that one day this repo can be a useful resource for people.
